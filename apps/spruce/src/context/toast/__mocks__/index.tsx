 * RenderFakeToastContext is a utility that takes a React Component which uses useToastContext and returns a
 * React Component which renders the component with the context mocked out.
 * It is meant to be used for testing components that rely on the useToastContext hook. It also exposes some
 * methods to assert that the toast context was called with the correct parameters.
 * @param Component - A React Component which uses useToastContext
 * @returns an object with the Component, the mocked useToastContext, and the dispatchToast methods
