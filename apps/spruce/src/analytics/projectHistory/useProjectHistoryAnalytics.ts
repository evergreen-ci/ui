/**
 * `useProjectHistoryAnalytics` is a custom hook that provides analytics tracking for project history pages.

 * It uses the same analytics object as the old project health pages. So that we can track the same events as they are migrated over to the new pages.
 * @param p - An object containing the page type.
 * @param p.page - The type of page being viewed.
 * @returns - An object containing the analytics tracking functions.
