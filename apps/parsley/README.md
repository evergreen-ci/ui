[Lobster](https://github.com/evergreen-ci/lobster).

## Getting Started

### Running Locally

1. Clone this GitHub repository.
2. Ensure you have Node.js 16.13+ and
   [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install) installed.
3. Run `yarn`.
4. Run `yarn run dev`. This will launch the app.

### Running against a remote Evergreen server

If you want to run Parsley against a remote Evergreen server, you can do so by
taking the following steps.

1. Generate a self signed certificate and add it to your keychain. This will
   allow you to run Parsley against a remote Evergreen server that uses HTTPS.
   Run the below command in the root of the Parsley repository.

```sh
brew install mkcert
mkcert -install
mkcert -key-file localhost-key.pem -cert-file localhost-cert.pem parsley-local.corp.mongodb.com
```

2. Update your `/etc/hosts` file and add the following entry

```sh
127.0.0.1  parsley-local.corp.mongodb.com
```

3. Run the following command to start the local UI server with the remote
   Evergreen server.

```sh
yarn <env_name>  # where env_name is the name of the environment you want to run staging or prod
```

4. Navigate to `https://parsley-local.corp.mongodb.com:8444` in your browser to
   view the Spruce UI.

### Starting supporting services

Parsley is capable of fetching logs from both
[evergreen](https://github.com/evergreen-ci/evergreen) and
[logkeeper](https://github.com/evergreen-ci/logkeeper). If you would like to
develop against them you will need to run both of the servers locally.

**Evergreen**

1. Clone the [Evergreen Repository](https://github.com/evergreen-ci/evergreen)
2. Follow the setup instructions in the README to set up your environment.
3. Run `make local-evergreen` to start the local evergreen server

**Logkeeper**

1. Clone the [Logkeeper Repository](https://github.com/evergreen-ci/logkeeper)
2. Run `yarn bootstrap-s3-logs` to download some sample resmoke logs from s3.
3. Run the command outputted by the previous step to seed the env variables and
   start the local logkeeper server with the following command:

   ```bash
   LK_CORS_ORIGINS=http:\/\/localhost:\\d+ LK_EVERGREEN_ORIGIN=http://localhost:8080 LK_PARSLEY_ORIGIN=http://localhost:5173 go run main/logkeeper.go --localPath {abs_path_to_parsley}/bin/_bucketdata
   ```

### GraphQL Type Generation

To be able to use code generation, you'll need to create a symlink to the
`schema` folder in Evergreen. This folder contains the definitions for our
GraphQL queries, mutations, and types.

To create a symlink, run the following command:

```
ln -s <path_to_evergreen_repo>/graphql/schema sdlschema
```

### Environment Variables

Read more about environment variables
[here](../../packages/deploy-utils/README.md#environment-variables).

### Common errors

- Sometimes you may run into an error where a dependency is out of date or in a
  broken state. If you run into this issue try running `yarn install` to
  reinstall all dependencies. If that does not work try deleting your
  `node_modules` folder and running `yarn install` again. You can use the
  `yarn clean` command to do this for you.
