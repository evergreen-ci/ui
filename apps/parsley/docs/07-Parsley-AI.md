# Parsley AI

Parsley AI is an intelligent assistant built directly into the **Parsley Log Viewer**. It’s designed to make debugging faster and easier by helping you understand your log files and related Evergreen task data.

## What Parsley AI Can Do

- **Understand your logs**
  Ask questions in natural language and Parsley AI will parse the log file for you, explaining what happened and why.

- **Debug failures quickly**
  If a task or test fails, Parsley AI can highlight the cause and summarize relevant error messages.

- **Query Evergreen for context**
  Parsley AI can fetch information about the specific task or test from Evergreen to give you a more complete picture.

- **Cross-log analysis**
  It can also read related log files and provide summaries, so you can understand issues across multiple runs in one view.

## Getting Started

1. Open a log file in the Parsley Log Viewer.
2. Click the **Parsley AI** button in the top right corner.
3. Ask a question about your task or test (for example: _“Why did this test fail?”_).
4. Review Parsley AI’s analysis and suggested next steps.
