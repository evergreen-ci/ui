## What Parsley AI Can Do

- **Understand your logs:**
  Ask questions in natural language and Parsley AI will parse the log file for you, explaining what happened and why.

- **Debug failures quickly:**
  If a task or test fails, Parsley AI can highlight the cause and summarize relevant error messages.

- **Query Evergreen for context:**
  Parsley AI can fetch information about the specific task or test from Evergreen to give you a more complete picture.

- **Cross-log analysis:**
  It can also read related log files and provide summaries, so you can understand issues across multiple runs in one view.

## How does Parsley AI work?

Parsley AI uses a combination of specialized agents to help you debug your log failure and suggest next steps. Every time you ask a question, Parsley AI will select the appropriate agent(s) to use to answer your question. It will analyze the question and come up with a plan of action.

- **Log Analyzer:** This agent, aka the "Log Core Analyzer", is responsible for analyzing the log file and identifying the root cause of the failure. It will use the log file to identify the root cause of the failure and is capable of analyzing a single log file with a guiding prompt on what it should look for.

- **Evergreen Agent**: This agent is responsible for querying Evergreen for information about the task or test. It can also research specific pieces of information pertaining to the task or test.
